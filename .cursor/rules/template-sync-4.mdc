# Task

This project is based on: https://github.com/starmode-base/template-tanstack-start
Update this project with the template’s latest changes **without losing project-specific edits**.

# Do

- Compare the template to this project (also handle moved/renamed files).
- Edit files **in this repo** as needed to bring it in sync.
- If a file here is identical to the old template version, overwrite with the new one.
- If a file has local changes, do a best-effort merge; ask before replacing anything non-trivial.
- For `package.json`, preserve `"name"`, `"version"`, `"private"`; union scripts and deps; prefer newer versions; sort keys.

# Don’t

- Do **not** run `git` commands in this repo (no branch/commit/push).

# Notes

- If there’s nothing to change, say so and stop.
- Keep edits minimal; avoid reformatting unrelated code.
