## Code Style

- Default to functional style, but be pragmatic and use imperative when needed
  - Prefer pure functions
  - Prefer immutability (local mutability is okay)

## Testing Philosophy

- Write code with testing in mind
  - Strive to write functions that can be tested without mocks
  - Create factories for boundary functions to support testing without mocks
