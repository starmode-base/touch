## Instructions

- Avoid premature/paranoid defensive programming; guard only against known error cases

## Code style

- Default to functional style, but be pragmatic and use imperative when needed
  - Prefer pure functions
  - Prefer immutability (local mutability is okay)

## Testing philosophy

- Write code with testing in mind
  - Strive to write functions that can be tested without mocks
  - Create factories for boundary functions to support testing without mocks

## Documentation

- Always use sentence case for titles (never title case)
- In code comments with _one_ sentence, omit the period
