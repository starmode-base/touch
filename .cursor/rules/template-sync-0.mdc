This app is based on this template:
https://github.com/starmode-base/template-tanstack-start

The template has been updated and improved several times since this project was started. I would like to update this project with those changes without losing project specific changes.

- Go through each file in the template and compare it to the equivalent file in this porject.
- Files may have moved in the template, and if so the corresponding project files should also be moved.
- Do your best to not remove project specfic customization.
