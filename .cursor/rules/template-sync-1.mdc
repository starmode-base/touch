# Background

This project is based on this template:
https://github.com/starmode-base/template-tanstack-start

# Goal

Safely apply changes from the template to this project derived from it.

# Instructions

The template has been updated and improved several times since this project was started. I would like to update this project with those changes without losing project specific changes.

- Go through each file in the template and compare it to the equivalent file in this project.
- Files may have moved in the template, and if so the corresponding project files should also be moved.
- Do your best to not remove project specfic customization.

# Special files instructions

- /.cursor/rules/update-from-template.mdc - Always copy this file as-is from the template
- /package.json - It is okay if dependency versions are later than those in the template. Make sure dependecies are correctly placed in "dependencies" and "devDependencies"
